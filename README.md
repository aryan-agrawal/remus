# remus
A discord bot implemented via the discord.py libraries that provides tools for conducting a game of One Night Werewolf on a private discord server.

Some of the implementation has been tailored specifically to include the servers I have used this bot with in the past, so those things will need to be slightly tweaked in order to make it playable on other discord servers. Also, the bot-specific token has been excluded from the file, but any user can create their own via the discord developer portal.

Use *pip install discord.py* to install the discord.py library. Documentation can be found here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html Thanks to the team behind discord.py for the library.

Type *$help* for a list of commands.

Disclaimer: This bot is not officially licensed or affiliated with Bezier Games in any way. I only made this bot to play over discord with my friends during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am not profiting off of it in any way.
